# noonien.serializer
A serialization mechanism to save and edit noonien graphs.

This is highly experimental.
TODO:
  * Remove yaml/messagepack experiments.
  * Inject INotifyManager into graph.
  * Clean up these files and make it into an actual thing that could be used.
    * Graph.Instantiate()?
  * Add UI to allow graphs to be edited.

DONE:
  * Very basic graphs can be serialized and deserialized to JSON.
